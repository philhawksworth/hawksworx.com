    <h1>Speaker Rider</h1>
    <p>My guidance and requirements for events I'll participate in</p>
  </hgroup>

I'm incredibly fortunate to be afforded the opportunity to speak at conferences and events. Before I'll agree to speak at, or to emmcee a conference, meetup, or event, I like to make sure that it aligns with my values, and my goals of inclusion and diversity.

I'll consider travelling to most places, and enjoy the experience of doing so, but time prohibits me from accepting every invitation, so please don't take it personally if I'm unable to accept yours. 

The guidance below should help making my accepting [an invite to your event](/ask-me/to-speak) easier.

## Hosting accommodations

### Speaker honorarium

<details>
  <summary>
    I ask for a speaker fee
  </summary>

- I ask for a speaker fee because speaking takes time, and talks ar the core product being offered by a conference. I often have to take time off work, or away from family to prepare a talk, to travel, and to attend, so I trust you value this as I do.
- I don't quote a standard price because it varies depending on the event.
- For non-profit events, I may choose to waive my honorarium based on ticket pricing, scholarship programs, etc.
- I understand that some events don't have budget to pay speakers, and I'll address this on a case-by-case basis.

</details>

<details>
  <summary>
    I expect your other speakers to be paid too
  </summary>

- I want to normalize people getting paid for their work speaking at conferences (especially underrepresented groups), so I prefer conferences that pay all of their speakers, and not just a select few. (psst, speakers talk to each other)
- "Exposure" is not a realistic form of conpensation for any speakers whatever their experience level, so please don't cite that.
</details>


### Travel

<details>
  <summary>
   I ask that travel to and from the event is provided
  </summary>

- I'm based just outside of London, UK. Assuming an event it is not local to me, either booking travel on my behalf or compensating me for my travel expenses is fine.
- I'd ask that expenses are reimbursed promptly. Doing so makes life easier for me, and this also provides a more inclusive model for those who can't front the cost of travel.
- I have some preferred airlines where I am a member of their reward schemes. If organisers book on my behalf, I'd prefer if you could use thos if the costs are comparitive and reasonable.

</details>


### Lodging

<details>
  <summary>
    I ask that lodging is provided for the full length of the event
  </summary>

- Unless the event is within easy reach of my home, in which case I'm usually happy to travel
- If your event is a significant time zone change from me (UK), I do ask that my arrival flight be booked to arrive a day or two before my speaking slot.
</details>

### Ticket

<details>
  <summary>
    I ask for a ticket to the full conference
  </summary>

- Part of the gig as a speaker is to participate in the conference and be avilable to attendees and egange with the event.
- As a speaker I request a ticket to the entire event, and not only the section of the event which migh be hosting my talk.
</details>



## Logistics

### Code of Conduct

<details>
  <summary>
    Your event must have a code of conduct
  </summary>

- A real, and actionable code of conduct is important for any event. I like to see these available from your event site in advance of the event.
- "Be nice to each other" or "don't be a jerk" might feel cute, but that won't suffice. We need to help provide a safe and inclusive environment, and this resource is a vital peice of that puzzle.
- The event's code of conduct needs to include information on points of contact and enforcement.
- Here are a couple of examaples of great codes of conduct: [JSConfEu](https://2019.jsconf.eu/code-of-conduct/) and [Rust Community](https://www.rust-lang.org/policies/code-of-conduct)
</details>


### No all-white, all-men lineups

<details>
  <summary>
    Have you looked in the mirror, Phil?
  </summary>
  
  - Heads up: Adding me to your event means adding yet nother white bloke. Does your lineup already have reasonable diversity?
  - I'm likely to decline invitations to events where the diverstiy in the lineup is poor. I'm happy to make recommendations if that is helpful.

</details>


### Recordings/Intellectual Property

<details>
  <summary>
    You may publish the recording of my talk
  </summary>
  
- Unless otherwise stated, I'm happy for you to record and publish my talk, with suitable acknowledgement.
- I usually use Apple Keynote to present my talk, and am happy to provide a PDF export of this for distribution after the event. Again, with suitable ackowledgement.

</details>

<details>
  <summary>
    I may publish the materials of my talk
  </summary>

- I reserve the right to publish the materials of my talk on my own site or to other platforms
- Any talks that I repeat tend to evolve over time and are likely to be tailored to your event, but I do not commit to creating exclusive or bespoke content for your event, or grant permission for exclusive access to this content to be provided to your customers.

</details>

### Equipment

<details>
  <summary>I prefer to present from my own computer</summary>

  - I have a strong preference for using my own laptop (MacBook Pro with USB C video out)
  - If I am required to use conference hardware, I will require:
    - Advice of this requirement a minumum of 2 weeks prior to the event
    - A compatible version of Apple Keynote to be available needs to be installed and available
    - A review of my presentation to ensure correct fonts and general visual integrity a minimum of 1 hour prior to my schdeuled talk time
    - A suitable remote control clicker
    - A timer and confidence monitor visible to me from the stage

</details>
