The ridiculous trend of giant, bloated web pages crammed with every visual bauble and gimmick imaginable seems set to continue. This time thanks to a site by Oakley.

<p>
    I have been gathering examples of this kind of site and using them as examples of what NOT to do in my talk "Excessive Enhancement" for some time.
</p>
<p>
    When <a href="http://bradfrostweb.com">Brad Frost</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/brad_frost/status/326425797768388608">alerted me</a> to this example though, I thought it had to be a spoof. Nobody would consider this to be a good idea would they? Really? These types of site, which uses HTML5, CSS3 and emerging web development techniques to create a page with parallax effects and animations as you scroll are frequently bloated and terrible citizens of the Web.
</p>

<h3>Vital statistics</h3>
<p>
    Without a primed cache, over my home broadband (advertised by my provider as 16meg but usually peaking around 11meg) this was my experience:
</p>
<blockquote>
    <ul>
        <li>85.4MB page weight</li>
        <li>471 HTTP requests</li>
        <li>2 minutes 45 seconds until loading screen replaced with content</li>
        <li>4 minutes 10 seconds minute onLoad event</li>
    </ul>
</blockquote>
<p>
    Astounding!
</p>
<p>
    You can visit the page to take a look while it is still around at <a href="http://moto.oakley.com/">http://moto.oakley.com</a> (I predict it might not last forever) but you can see a video of it below at a cost of just 28.5MB (saving you almost 60MB of bandwidth and allowing you to skip 2 minutes 45 seconds ahead to see the site)
</p>

<p>
    Now, I want these things to stop emerging, but at the same time, I'd rather not let Brad beat me with this example. Does anyone have a better (worse) example out there to share? Send them my way on Twitter at <a href="http://twitter.com/philhawksworth">@philhawksworth</a>

<h3>Update</h3>
<p>
    Oakley responded and have updated this site. Some of the particulars are in my follow-up post: <a href="/blog/oakleys-moto-diet/">Oakley's Moto diet</a>
