    This site is the online home of Phil Hawksworth. He doesn't love talking about himself in the third person, so he's going to stop that now if you don't mind.

<h2 id="about-me">ðŸ‘‹ Thanks for stopping by</h2>
<p>
  I have been building things on the web professionally for almost 20 years. Between 2009 and 2018 that happened at agencies where I was fortunate to work with a wide range of public and private sector clients.
</p>
<p>
  After 9 years working at agencies, I returned to working on a product. Now as part of the Developer Experience team at <a href="https://www.netlify.com">Netlify</a> my focus is on developing strategies for using <a href="https://www.jamstack.org">JAMstack</a> technologies to make building for the web simpler, faster and more secure.
</p>

<h2 id="home-in-the-world">Home in the world</h2>
<p>
  I live in the leafy English city of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St_Albans">St Albans</a>, just a few miles north of London with my wife and our 2 naughty cats.
</p>

  If you want to know more, you can <a href="/ask-me">ask me anything</a>.
