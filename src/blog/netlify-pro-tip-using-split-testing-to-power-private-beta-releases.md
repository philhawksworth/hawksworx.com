An explanation and short video demo of how to create your own opt-in UI for a private beta features of your site using [Netlify](https://netlify.com) features like branch deploys and split testing.

You could use this with any type of site you like, regardless of what tools or static site generator you used to create it. The example in the video was a site created with Hugo, but it could be anything. I also use it regularly with sites made with Gatsby or Eleventy.
