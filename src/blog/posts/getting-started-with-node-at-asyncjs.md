Yesterday I had the pleasure of talking about <a href="http://nodejs.org">Node</a> at <a href="http://asyncjs.com/intro-nodejs/">AsyncJS</a><a></a>, a meetup of smart and motivated developers and tech enthusiasts in Brighton.

<p>Async, which is organised by <a href="http://twitter.com/premasagar">Premasagar Rose</a> of <a href="http://dharmafly.com">Dharmafly</a> fame meets every 2 weeks and is a regular haunt for members of Brighton's thriving technology community. My talk on Node is not the first on the topic at Async, which has already seen great sessions from <a href="http://asyncjs.com/nodejs/">Simon Willison</a> and <a href="http://asyncjs.com/express/">Alex Young</a>, but focused on getting started with Node.js and looked at some of the tools created by the Node community to help ease development.</p>
<p>The slides from my talk are available now on <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/philhawksworth/getting-started-with-developing-nodejs">Slideshare</a> or to download as a <a href="http://static.hawksworx.com/asyncjs-nodejs.pdf">PDF</a>. The complete <a href="http://static.hawksworx.com/asyncjs-nodejs.key">Keynote presentation</a> is available for download too, but weighs in at a hefty 182MB due to some animated screen-captures.</p>
