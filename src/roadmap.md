title: Site Roadmap

Tracking the development roadmap for this site.

<div class="roadmap">

## Site search
Provide simple unified search functionality across all the content types of this site.

## Add speaker rider page
Publish details of my requirements for speaking at events along with other helpful content for event organisers.

## Style feed page
Use XSLT to transform the feeds page and make it beautiful

## Self-host tweets
Host my Twitter archive from this domain so that it lives beyond the twitter trash fire.

## Add rich markdown {.done}
Use markdown-it-attr to add support for some more convenient markdown expressions

## Refactor to Liquid {.done}
From Nunjucks. Mostly for VS Code convenience and also since seems to be a more healthy and maintained library
