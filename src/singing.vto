    After a lifetime of being shy about singing in public, I found choral singing and it brings me significant joy.
  </p>
  <p>
  You can read about <a href="/posts/on-song/">my journey to singing</a>, if you're curious about the backstory.
  </p>
  <p>
   This page is mostly a reminder for me about the fantsastic opportunities and experiences that I've had as a result of this fulfilling hobby, but also holds links to upcoming concerts where you can buy tickets.
