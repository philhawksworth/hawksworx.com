On April 1st, I'll be speaking at the <a href="http://html5devconf.com">HTML5DevConf</a> at the Palace Hotel in San Francisco. I'll be giving a version of my "I can smell yor CMS" talk which looks at how content managment systems can adversily effect performance and experience in the front-end.

<h3>Here's the synopsis:</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>
    The word is getting out. Great web site experiences require careful development and crafty execution in the front end. Squeezing every drop of performance out of your user's browser is tough, but Steve Souders and friends have mobilized an army, and we are all having a bloody good go.
</p>
<p>
    But there is a common threat to doing great work in the front-end. It lurks in the back-end and clients love it. It's the content management system, and more often than not, it stinks.
</p>
    We'll look at examples of the damaging traces CMSs leave behind in the front-end and at how we might work to reduce them. We'll find ways to fight for what matters in a CMS, and ways to avoid the smell of your CMS wafting over to the user and sacrificing the craftsmanship of good front-end engineering.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
    I'll be presenting at 4pm on Monday 1st of April (no, really!) in the Twin Peaks room. Do come along and say hello.

<h3>Update:</h3>
<p>
    Once again, this session was well received which is an encouraging sign. A number of people asked about getting a recording of the talk.
