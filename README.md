Phil Hawksworth's blog.  Served up at [https://www.hawksworx.com](https://www.hawksworx.com) and hosted on [Netlify](http://www.netlify.com)


## Overview

This site is comprised of static files generated by Hugo for simplified deployment and hosting. It uses Gulp to automate some build optimisation tasks and to improve performance.


## Environment installation

To build the site you need:

- [Hugo](https://gohugo.io)
- [Node and NPM] (https://nodejs.org)
- [Gulp](https://gulpjs.com)


To setup the build environment, clone the repository and then in the working directory run: `npm install` to install any node modules required by the build.

The site can then be built via npm with the command:

`npm run build`


## Deployment

The build command above will generate a set of static assets in a `dist` folder which can be deployed to any web hosting service.

My preferred method is to host on [Netlify](http://www.netlify.com) who can also run this build process in their own CI environment and then deploy the build to their distributed CDN. Such deployments are triggered automatically by every git push to the `master` branch of the origin repository.


## Development

To develop the site locally, run:

- `npm run watch` to monitor and regenerate all Sass code automatically
- `hugo server --disableFastRender` to monitor and rebuild the entire site automatically (and reload the local site)


## other commands

`npm run cards` at the end of the build process (`npm run build`) but can be invoked separately of desired. This generates image assets based on a special "card" output format for every page in the site. The images are copied to the `dist/images` directory and are referenced as an Open Graph asset in each page in order to be served as Twitter cards and open graph assets omn Facebook.
