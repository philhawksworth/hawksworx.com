Phil Hawksworth's blog.  Served up at [https://www.hawksworx.com](https://www.hawksworx.com) and hosted on [Netlify](http://www.netlify.com)


## Overview

This site is comprised of static files generated by [Eleventy](https://11ty.io) for simplified deployment and hosting. It uses Gulp to automate some build optimisation tasks and to improve performance.


## Local development

To build the site you need:

- [Node](https://nodejs.org) - to run the build
- [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com) - to install and manage dependencies


### Getting started

```bash

# clone this repository
git clone git@github.com:philhawksworth/hawksworx.com.git

# go to the working directory
cd hawksworx.com

# install dependencies
yarn

# start a local build server with hot reloading
yarn start
```


## Deployment

[![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/793e740d-7c84-4e39-b528-a34be81cd71e/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/hawksworx/deploys)

The build command `yarn run build` will generate a set of static assets in a `dist` folder which can be deployed to any web hosting service.

My preferred method is to host on [Netlify](http://www.netlify.com) which can run this build process in a CI environment and then deploy the build to automatically to a global CDN. Such deployments are [triggered automatically](https://www.netlify.com/docs/continuous-deployment/) by every git push to the `master` branch of the origin repository.
