After speaking about [JAMstack and Serverless Web](https://findthat.at/nejs) at the rather wonderful  at [Nebraska JS](https://nejsconf.com) in Omaha, I got the chance to hangout and chat with Bryan on the [TalkScript podcast](https://www.sitepen.com/blog/episode-42-rethinking-deployment/).

We spoke about what static really means, old and new deployment approaches, how JAMstack sites can raise the confidence in your web projects, and a few other things from my talk.
